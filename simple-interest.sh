Analyzing the information you've provided about the possible contents of a repository containing a script named simple_interest.sh, here's a likely scenario:

Functionality:

The script simple_interest.sh is likely a shell script written for Unix-based systems.
Its purpose is to calculate the simple interest for a given principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
Content:

The script would likely start with a shebang line (#!/bin/bash) specifying the interpreter to be used for execution.
It would then prompt the user to enter the principal amount, interest rate, and time period using the read command.
The script would perform the calculation for simple interest using the formula: Simple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time / 100. This might involve using the expr command for basic arithmetic operations.
Finally, the script would display the calculated simple interest and potentially the final amount (principal + interest) using the echo command.
License:

The presence of a LICENSE file suggests the script is open-source, but it doesn't guarantee the specific license. You'd need to check the file's contents to confirm the license type (e.g., Apache 2.0).
Other Files (Optional):

The repository might contain additional files such as:
CONTRIBUTING.md - A guide for contributing to the project (not essential for a simple script).
CODE_OF_CONDUCT - A document outlining expected behavior within the project (less likely for a simple script).
Overall:

This is a basic shell script for a common financial calculation. While the specific implementation details might vary, the core functionality and structure would likely follow this pattern.
