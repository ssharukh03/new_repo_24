A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file establishes expectations for respectful and productive interactions within a project or community. Here's what it typically contains:

Standards of behavior: This outlines what kind of behavior is expected from participants, promoting a welcoming and inclusive environment. Examples include using respectful language, being open to different viewpoints, and focusing on the project's goals.
Unacceptable behavior: This defines actions that are not tolerated, such as harassment, discrimination, insults, or publishing private information.
Reporting mechanism: This explains how to report violations of the code of conduct. It might involve contacting specific individuals or teams within the project.
Enforcement procedures: This outlines the steps taken when a violation is reported. This could involve warnings, temporary bans, or even permanent removal from the project.
Here are some additional points to consider:

Importance: A code of conduct helps foster a positive and productive environment, attracting and retaining contributors.
Adoption: Many open-source projects adopt existing code of conduct templates, such as the Contributor Covenant https://www.contributor-covenant.org/.
Location: The CODE_OF_CONDUCT file is typically placed in the root directory of the project repository for easy access.
I can't definitively tell if a specific repository has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file without access to the repository itself. However, you can often find this information by:

Checking the project's documentation or README file for mentions of a code of conduct.
Looking for a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file directly in the repository on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub).
